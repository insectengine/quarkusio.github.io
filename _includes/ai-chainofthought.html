      <h1>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning</h1>
      <p>The architecture of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) blueprint focuses on guiding a Large Language Model (LLM) through explicit intermediate steps to solve complex problems, improve reasoning, and provide transparency in its decision-making.</p>
      <h2>Main Use-Cases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Reasoning:</strong> Decompose complex problems to reduce logical errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Provide optional explanations for decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Training & Enablement:</strong> Illustrate the "why" behind concepts, not just the "what."</li>
        <li><strong>Decision Support:</strong> Aid in investments, vendor selection, and risk assessments.</li>
        <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> Facilitate structured diagnostics in operations and engineering.</li>
        <li><strong>Policy Application:</strong> Apply multi-clause rules with traceable steps.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
      <p>The CoT architecture starts with a "User Query" that initiates the process. This query is received by the "Quarkus CoT Service," which serves as the orchestrator for the entire reasoning flow. Within the Quarkus service, the core Chain-of-Thought logic, powered by LangChain4j, is executed.</p>

      <p>The "LangChain4j" package encapsulates the sequential steps of the CoT process:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="width-4-12 width-12-12-m">
      <dl>
        <dt>Step 1: Analyze Factors:</dt> 
        <dd>This initial step involves the LLM breaking down the complex user query into its constituent parts, identifying key factors, and performing an initial analysis. This could involve understanding the problem, identifying relevant data points, or defining the scope of the task.</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
    <div class="width-4-12 width-12-12-m">
      <dl>
        <dt>Step 2: Synthesize Options:</dt> 
        <dd>Building on the analysis from Step 1, the LLM then synthesizes various options, potential solutions, or different perspectives related to the query. This step demonstrates the model's ability to explore different avenues of thought before arriving at a conclusion.</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
    <div class="width-4-12 width-12-12-m">
      <dl>
        <dt>Step 3: Recommendation:</dt>
        <dd>In the final step, the LLM formulates a "Recommendation" or a definitive answer based on the analysis and synthesis performed in the preceding steps. This recommendation is the ultimate output of the CoT process.</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
    <div class="width-12-12 width-12-12-m">
      <p>Finally, the Response is returned to the user, with the option to include the intermediate reasoning steps when transparency is required. Quarkus orchestrates the execution of single- or multi-prompt chains, while LangChain4j supplies the abstractions for building prompts and capturing reasoning outputs at each step. This structured flow improves the LLMâ€™s performance on complex tasks and, when needed, provides an auditable record of how the answer was derived.</p>
      <h2>Further Patterns</h2>
      <p>Further patterns in Chain-of-Thought reasoning extend beyond basic single-prompt approaches to offer more sophisticated control and integration. "Single-prompt CoT" provides a concise way to elicit reasoning, where a single instruction like "think step by step" guides the LLM to return both its thought process and the final answer.</p>
      <p>More advanced scenarios benefit from "Program-of-Thought," which involves multiple chained prompts, where the output of one step feeds into the next, often including optional verification steps for enhanced accuracy.</p>
      <p>Lastly, a "Hybrid" approach combines CoT with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground the reasoning process in factual information, ensuring that the LLM's logical steps are supported by relevant data. These patterns provide flexibility in how CoT is applied, allowing architects to choose the level of control and factual grounding necessary for their specific enterprise AI applications.</p>
      <h2>Guardrails & Privacy</h2>
      <p>Architecting Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions for enterprise environments necessitates careful consideration of guardrails and privacy. The following points represent an initial excerpt of critical aspects that software architects must account for to ensure responsible and secure AI deployment. These considerations are vital to manage the transparency of reasoning, maintain answer consistency, and control data exposure within the CoT process.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reasoning Exposure:</strong> Decide whether to reveal the Chain of Thought (CoT) or keep it internal.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency Checks:</strong> Implement a final verifier prompt or apply deterministic post-rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Token Budgeting:</strong> Limit intermediate verbosity and summarize between steps.</li>
      </ul>
