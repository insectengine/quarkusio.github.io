      <h2>Java in Data Preparation</h2>
      <p>Many AI initiatives begin with robust data processing pipelines.</p>
      <h3>Effective AI requires two distinct pipelines:</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="width-6-12 width-12-12-m">
      <dl>
        <dt>Training Data Preparation</dt>
        <dd>Build predictive models with DeepLearning4J (DL4J). Java’s ecosystem, including Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and Apache Camel, supports large-scale ETL, data cleansing, and preprocessing across enterprise data.</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
    <div class="width-6-12 width-12-12-m">
    <dl>
        <dt>RAG Data Preparation</dt>
        <dd>For Retrieval-Augmented Generation, ingest documents and business knowledge, compute embeddings, and index in vector stores. Java seamlessly connects to databases, message brokers, and vector stores, enabling RAG pipelines that are both fast and reliable.</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
    <div class="width-12-12 width-12-12-m">
      <p>This dual capability, supporting both model training and RAG processes, makes Java uniquely powerful in AI architectures.</p>

      <h2>Java for AI-Infused Applications and Intelligent Applications</h2>
      <p>Once data and models are ready, enterprises need applications that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Embed AI in customer-facing workflows (chatbots, fraud detection, document assistants).</li>
        <li>Interact with predictive and generative AI models (in-process, locally or remotely).</li>
        <li>Scale from prototype to production on cloud or on-prem.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The JVM ecosystem ensures consistency, portability, and performance across deployments.</p>

      <h2>Java & Emerging AI Protocols</h2>
      <p>The Java ecosystem has long been foundational for interoperability.</p>
      <p>So, it’s not surprising to see Java client and server implementations for the emerging AI protocols, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>MCP (Model context Protocol):</strong> Enables building servers and clients that integrate LLMs with enterprise systems.</li>
        <li><strong>A2A (Agent-to-Agent):</strong> Supports reliable autonomous agent communication across ecosystems.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Java’s mature networking and concurrency capabilities make it ideal for implementing these agentic, AI-driven architectures.</p>
