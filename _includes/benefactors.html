        <h2>Quarkus Extension Benefactors</h2>
        <p>In the Quarkiverse, individual extensions often benefit from the support of their own benefactors, which can range from enthusiastic companies to dedicated community initiatives. These supporters recognize the value an extension brings to the Quarkus ecosystem and provide resources, be it developer time, financial backing, or infrastructure, to ensure its continued development and maintenance. This decentralized sponsorship model allows for a diverse and vibrant array of extensions, each nurtured by those who most directly benefit from or believe in its specific functionality, ultimately fostering innovation and stability within the broader Quarkus community.</p>
        <p>You can see the individual extension supports by viewing the Community tab of the extensions' page in the <a href="http://quarkus.io/extensions">Extension Catalog</a>.
