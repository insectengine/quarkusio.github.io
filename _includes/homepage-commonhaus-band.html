      <h2>Quarkus is part of the Commonhaus Foundation</h2>
      <p>In order to fulfill our goal of being a more inclusive and fostering a more collaborative environment, we have moved to the Commonhaus Foundation. This is a step to further solidify our commitment to open-source development and enterprise adoption, addressing the perception that it was overly dependent on a single vendor (Red Hat). This move aims to provide a neutral ground where other organizations and contributors can feel equally valued and involved, ensuring Quarkus continues to thrive, supported by a broad base of contributors from multiple organizations.</p>
