As mentioned in previous blog posts, we encourage all our community users to upgrade to Quarkus 3.
Most of the heavy lifting can be done with https://quarkus.io/guides/update-quarkus[`quarkus update`]
but be aware that some components were updated to new major versions
and that migrating might require some time and careful testing if you are using these components.

We will continue to maintain 2.16.x until the end of October so we recommend that you start your migration process very soon.
Today, we released Quarkus 2.16.12.Final, the twelfth maintenance release of our 2.16 release train.

This release fixes several CVEs:

- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487[CVE-2023-44487] for Netty
- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39410[CVE-2023-39410] for Apache Avro
- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-34454[CVE-2023-34454] for Snappy

It should be a safe upgrade for anyone already using 2.16.

If you are not already using 2.16, please refer to https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-2.16[our migration guide].
