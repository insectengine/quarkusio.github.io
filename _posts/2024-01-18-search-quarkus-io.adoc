The Quarkus documentation has had a search feature for a long time,
but until now it was a simple substring search on the title and summary of each guide.
It was better than nothing, but admittedly quite limited.

We've recently improved on that.
The https://quarkus.io/guides/[guides page] now provides actual full-text search:

NOTE: The feature is not yet available on https://quarkus.io/blog/l10n-of-quarkusio/[localized sites],
but will be in a few days, after their next sync.

Among the (many!) improvements:

* This is no longer a simple substring search, but state-of-the-art full-text search,
  with tokenization and text analysis (see how `vertx` matched `Vert.x` above?).
* Results are sorted by relevance,
  thanks to the ability of full-text to assign a score to each hit.
* Search takes into account the title and summary of each guide,
  but also the _full content of the guide's HTML page_.
* Matching terms get highlighted in the list of results,
  giving a glimpse of relevant content from each guide.

And the best part? This new search is backed by a https://github.com/quarkusio/search.quarkus.io[Quarkus app]!
It uses in particular the https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-search-orm-elasticsearch[Hibernate Search extension],
which provides https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/search/reference/en-US/html_single/#elasticsearch-integration[integration with OpenSearch/Elasticsearch].

Stay tuned for more details in the coming weeks as we publish more blog posts to dive into the implementation details.
In the meantime, happy searching!
