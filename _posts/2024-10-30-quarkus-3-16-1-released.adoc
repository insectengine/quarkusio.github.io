After the 3.15 LTS release comes Quarkus 3.16 and a lot of new features and enhancements.

Quarkus 3.16 is the result of the 2 month worth of work so it's more packed than your usual Quarkus minor.

Note that we haven't forgotten 3.15 LTS, a 3.15.2 LTS is in the works and will be released in November.
We are carefully selecting the fixes we will backport to it.

== Update

To update to Quarkus 3.16, we recommend updating to the latest version of the Quarkus CLI and run:

[source,bash]
----
quarkus update
----

Note that `quarkus update` can update your applications from any version of Quarkus (including 2.x) to Quarkus 3.16.

For more information about the adjustments you need to make to your applications, please refer to the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.16[Quarkus 3.16 migration guide].

== What's new?

=== Big Reactive Rename compatibility layer dropped

Remember the Big Reactive Rename?
It happened in 3.9 with the ultimate goal of avoiding the confusion between extensions that have a reactive core and are supporting equally well reactive and non-reactive workloads and extensions that are purely designed as reactive.

A lot of extensions were renamed and we put in place relocations both for the artifacts and for the configuration.

Compatibility layers have a cost and we decided to drop this one in 3.16, after the 3.15 LTS release.

If you encounter issues with this change, please refer to the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.9[Quarkus 3.9 migration guide].

If you are using `quarkus update` to update to each new version, the changes were handled for you already.

=== OpenTelemetry Logging

Quarkus 3.16 supports distributed logging via OpenTelemetry Logging.
This is the natural continuation of the OpenTelemetry work in Quarkus.

This support is part of the already existing OpenTelemetry extension and can be easily enabled via configuration properties.

To learn more about it, have a look at the https://quarkus.io/guides/opentelemetry-logging[dedicated guide]

=== LGTM dashboard

When using the LGTM Dev Services, an out of the box Quarkus dashboard will now be provided.

=== Quarkus REST

In Quarkus REST, you can use custom classes as parameters of your REST methods but records were not supported.
It is now the case in Quarkus 3.16.

When using the REST Client, providing a URL is mandatory and you usually configure it globally.
However, from time to time, you might want to configure it per-invocation.
The `@Url` annotation was introduced for that: annotate a parameter of your REST Client method with it and you can dynamically provide a URL.

=== Jackson

You might remember that in Quarkus 3.14, we introduced https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-3-14-1-released/#faster-reflection-free-jackson-serializers[faster reflection-free serializers].

And you might have wondered "where are my faster reflection-free **de**serializers"?

They just landed in 3.16!

=== Security

As usual, this version comes with several new features and enhancements related to our security layer:

* https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/41866[#41866] - Add quarkus-oidc-client-registration extension - see https://quarkus.io/guides/security-openid-connect-client-registration[documentation] here
* https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/42749[#42749] - Add new AuthorizationPolicy annotation to bind named HttpSecurityPolicy to a Jakarta REST endpoints - see https://quarkus.io/guides/security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference#authorization-policy-example[documentation] here
* https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/42879[#42879] - Add OIDC Client SPI - see https://quarkus.io/guides/security-openid-connect-client-reference#oidc-client-spi[documentation] here
* https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/43241[#43241] - Support `@PermissionsAllowed` defined on meta-annotation - see https://quarkus.io/guides/security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference#permission-meta-annotation[documentation] here
* https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/43283[#43283] - Introduce `OidcResponseFilter` - see https://quarkus.io/guides/security-oidc-code-flow-authentication#code-flow-oidc-response-filters[documentation] here
* https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/42935[#42935] - Support for two or more authentications for a single request - described https://quarkus.io/guides/security-authentication-mechanisms[here]
* https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/43609[#43609] - Support Keycloak Dev Service when OIDC client is used without OIDC extension

=== TLS registry everywhere

The TLS registry was introduced in Quarkus a while ago and we are iterating in each version to migrate more extensions to it.

In Quarkus 3.16, two new extensions have been adapted to rely on the centralized TLS registry:

- SmallRye GraphQL Client
- Keycloak Admin Client

=== Dev UI

The Dev UI is continuously enhanced but we wanted to highlight a very nice addition:
logs from your Dev Services containers and HTTP access logs are now available in the Dev UI.

=== Configuration documentation

When developing extensions, it can be handy to publish your configuration documentation.

Until now, it was only possible to publish it in Asciidoc.
With 3.16, you can also generate Markdown by passing `<format>markdown</format>` to the configuration of the Config Doc Maven Plugin.

=== Platform component upgrades

==== Camel Quarkus

Camel Quarkus has been updated to 3.16.0.

==== Quarkus CXF

Quarkus CXF 3.16 was released and is now available in https://code.quarkus.io/?extension-search=origin:platform%20quarkus-cxf[Quarkus Platform 3.16].
Check the https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-cxf/dev/release-notes/3.16.0.html[Quarkus CXF 3.16.0] release notes for more information about what is new in this release.
