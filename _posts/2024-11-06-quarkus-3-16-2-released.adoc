We released Quarkus 3.16.2, a maintenance release for our 3.16 release train.

In this version, we upgraded the PostgreSQL Dev Services to PostgreSQL 17,
as older versions had issues on Mac Mx architecture.
If it is a problem for your applications, you can go back to a previous image by setting the `quarkus.datasource.devservices.image-name=...` configuration property (or `quarkus.datasource."datasource-name".devservices.image-name=...` for a named datasource).

== Update

To update to Quarkus 3.16, we recommend updating to the latest version of the Quarkus CLI and run:

[source,bash]
----
quarkus update
----

Note that `quarkus update` can update your applications from any version of Quarkus (including 2.x) to Quarkus 3.16.

For more information about the adjustments you need to make to your applications, please refer to the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.16[Quarkus 3.16 migration guide].
