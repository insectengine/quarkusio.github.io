See how BCE/ECB keeps Java applications clean, testable, and future-proof. With rules that fail the build when you break them in "Guard Your Code: Enforcing Architecture Boundaries in Quarkus with ArchUnit" by Markus Eisele. Elder Moraes's "Building a Web-Searching Agent with Ollama, Langchain4j, and Quarkus" is a great guide that provides a step-by-step, hands-on tutorial for Java developers to construct a sophisticated AI agent that embodies the new paradigm where the model can autonomously decide it needs more information and knows how to get it. A2A Java SDK 0.3.0.Alpha1 makes it possible to quickly get started with Quarkus and A2A using the latest, more stable version of the A2A protocol. Read "Getting Started with Quarkus and A2A Java SDK 0.3.0" by Farah Juma to learn more. Explore some ways to develop, deploy and run applications on AWS Lambda using Quarkus framework with "How to Develop, Run and Optimize Quarkus Web Application on AWS Lambda" by Vadym Kazulkin. Java developers need to preserve the qualities we know matter: correctness, security, and maintainability but also need to embrace a new class of technologies that behave very differently from what we’re used to. Learn more about it in "The Java Developer’s Dilemma: Part 1" by Markus Eisele.

You will also see the latest Quarkus Insights episodes, top tweets/discussions and upcoming Quarkus attended events.
